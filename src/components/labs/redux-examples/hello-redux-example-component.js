/*
The component uses redux's useSelector hook to extract the message from the reducer.
When the component loads, reducers pass their data in the function declared in useSelector.
In the code below, the parameter hello in (hello) => { â€¦ }, gets the object returned by the reducers,
e.g., {message: 'Hello World'}, therefore, (hello) => hello.message returns 'Hello World',
and that's the value const message is initialized with.

The component goes on to render 'Hello World' in an H1 element.
